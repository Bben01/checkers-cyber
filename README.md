# Checkers Game using Unity and Minimax

---

The game is composed of multiple parts:  
  - A graphic interface in Unity  
  - A REST server in python  
  - The game logic (in python)  
  - The AI, currently Alpha-Beta Pruning, but I am working on implementing [MuZero](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general)
